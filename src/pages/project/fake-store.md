This proyect was build with React Js with Create-React-App and Fake Store API (https://fakestoreapi.com/) and deployed with Vercel https://fake-e-commerce-4ufa4kv4z-nfsedg.vercel.app/

For this proyect I implement react-router-dom for routing pages for each category and article. implementing CSS Modules for each component and axios for fetching data of API.

Due the store API doesn't have an option to store new data, like new users or new products or modify the existing data, I use the login for the application an existing user on the API.

You can login with the following pre-generated user: 
Username: johnd 
Password: m38rmF$
